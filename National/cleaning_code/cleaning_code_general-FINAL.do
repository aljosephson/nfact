	* OMITTED MISSING (i.e., missing values from questions respondents DID NOT
		see, due to survey logic, and did NOT (could not) answer) are 
		recorded in Qualtrics as BLANKS and Stata as ".a"
	* Values of "I DON'T KNOW" or similar are coded as 99 
	* Values of "DOES NOT APPLY / NOT APPLICABLE ' ETC. are coded as 88
